\begin{document}
Let $V$ be a real (or complex) topological vector space and $X$ a subset of $V$.
A {\em conical neighborhood} of $X$ is a cone in $V$ which is a neighborhood of $X$.

In the theory of pseudodifferential operators and in microlocal analysis, we have to consider conical neighborhood of vectors located in some fiber of a vector bundle.
