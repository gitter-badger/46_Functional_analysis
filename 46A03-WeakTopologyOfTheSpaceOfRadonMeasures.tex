Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space.
Let $M(X)$ denote the space of complex Radon measures on $X$, and
$C_0(X)^*$ denote the dual of the $C_0(X)$, the complex-valued continuous functions on $X$
vanishing at infinity, equipped with the uniform norm.
By the Riesz Representation Theorem, $M(X)$ is isometric to $C_0(X)^*$,
The isometry maps a measure $\mu$ into the linear functional $I_\mu(f) = \int_X f \, d\mu$.

The weak-* topology (also called the vague topology) on $C_0(X)^*$,
is simply the topology of pointwise convergence of $I_\mu$: 
$I_{\mu_\alpha} \to I_{\mu}$ if and only if
$I_{\mu_\alpha}(f) \to I_{\mu}(f)$ for each $f \in C_0(X)$.

The corresponding topology on $M(X)$ induced by the isometry from $C_0(X)^*$ is also called
the weak-* or vague topology on $M(X)$.  Thus one may talk about ``weak convergence'' of measures 
$\mu_n \to \mu$.  One of the most important applications of this notion is in probability theory:
for example, the central limit theorem is essentially the statement that
if $\mu_n$ are the distributions for certain sums of independent random variables.
then $\mu_n$ converge weakly to a normal distribution,
i.e. the distribution $\mu_n$ is ``approximately normal'' for large $n$.
