\begin{document}
Let $V$ be a normed vector space with norm $\| \cdot \|$. Let $M$ be a closed subspace of $V$ and $V/M$ the
 quotient vector space.

The norm $\| \cdot \|$ induces a norm $\| \cdot \|_{V/M}$ in $V/M$, called the {\bf quotient norm}, given by

\begin{displaymath}
\| v+M \|_{V/M}:= \inf_{u \in v+M} \|u\| = \inf_{m \in M} \|v+m\|
\end{displaymath}

{\bf Theorem -} $\| \cdot \|_{V/M}$ is a norm in $V/M$ iff $M$ is closed in $V$.
