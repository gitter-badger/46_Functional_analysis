%\begin{theorem}
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded subset of $\R^n$ and $(f_k)$ a sequence of functions $f_k\colon \Omega\to \R^m$. If $\{f_k\}$ is equibounded and uniformly equicontinuous then there exists a uniformly convergent subsequence $(f_{k_j})$.
%\end{theorem}

A more abstract (and more general) version is the following.

%\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be totally bounded metric spaces and let $F\subset \mathcal C(X,Y)$ be an uniformly equicontinuous family of continuous mappings from $X$ to $Y$. 
Then $F$ is totally bounded (with respect to the uniform convergence metric induced by $\mathcal C (X,Y)$).
%\end{theorem}

Notice that the first version is a consequence of the second. 
Recall, in fact, that a subset of a complete metric space is totally bounded if and only if its closure is compact (or sequentially compact).
Hence $\Omega$ is totally bounded and all the functions $f_k$ have image in a totally bounded set. Being $F=\{f_k\}$ totally bounded means that $\overline F$ is sequentially compact and hence $(f_k)$ has a convergent subsequence.
