(Following \cite{reed, igari}.)
%{\bf Proof.} 
Let $u\in \cD(U)$. Then $\supp u \subset [-k,k]$ for
some $k>0$. For any $\varepsilon>0$,  $u(x)/x$ is Lebesgue integrable 
in $|x|\in[\varepsilon,k]$. Thus, by a change of variable, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cpv(u) &=& \lim_{\varepsilon\to0+} \int_{[\varepsilon,k]} \frac{u(x)-u(-x)}{x} dx.
\end{eqnarray*}
Now it is clear that the integrand is continuous for all $x\in \sR\setminus\{0\}$.
What is more, the integrand approaches $2u'(0)$ for $x\to 0$, so the
integrand has a removable discontinuity at $x=0$. That is, by assigning the value 
$2u'(0)$ to the integrand at $x=0$, the integrand becomes continuous in $[0,k]$.
This means that the integrand is Lebesgue measurable on $[0,k]$. 
Then, by defining
$f_n(x) = \chi_{[1/n,k]} \big(u(x)-u(-x)\big)/x$
(where $\chi$ is the characteristic function), and
applying the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cpv(u) &=& \int_{[0,k]} \frac{u(x)-u(-x)}{x} dx.
\end{eqnarray*}
It follows that $\cpv(u)$ is finite, i.e., $\cpv$ takes values in $\sC$. 
Since $\cD(U)$ is a vector space, if follows easily from the above expression 
that $\cpv$ is linear. 

To prove that $\cpv$ is continuous, we shall use condition (3) on 
\PMlinkname{this page}{Distribution4}.      
For this, suppose $K$ is a compact subset of $\sR$ and 
$u\in \cD_K$. Again, we can assume that $K\subset [-k,k]$ for some $k>0$.
For $x>0$, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
|\frac{u(x)-u(-x)}{x}| &=& |\frac{1}{x}\int_{(-x,x)} u'(t) dt| \\
&\le &  2 ||u'||_\infty,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $||\cdot||_\infty$ is the supremum norm. In the first equality we have used the
fundamental theorem of calculus for the Lebesgue integral (valid since 
$u$ is absolutely continuous on $[-k,k]$). Thus
$$ |\cpv(u)| \le 2k ||u'||_\infty$$
and $\cpv$ is a \PMlinkname{distribution of first order}{Distribution4} as claimed. $\Box$
