{\bf \PMlinkescapetext{Proposition} -} Let $T$ be an operator in a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ acting on an Hilbert space $H$. Then the orthogonal projection onto the range of $T$ and the orthogonal projection onto the kernel of $T$ both belong to $\mathcal{M}$.

{\bf Proof :} Let $T=VR$ be the polar decomposition of $T$ with $KerV=KerR$.

By the result on the \PMlinkname{parent entry}{PolarDecompositionInVonNeumannAlgebras} we see that $V \in \mathcal{M}$.

As $V$ is a partial isometry, $VV^*$ is the (\PMlinkescapetext{orthogonal}) projection onto the range of $T$, and $I-V^*V$ is the (\PMlinkescapetext{orthogonal}) projection onto the kernel of $T$, where $I$ is the identity operator in $\mathcal{M}$.

Therefore the (\PMlinkescapetext{orthogonal}) projections onto the range and kernel of $T$ both belong to $\mathcal{M}$. $\square$
