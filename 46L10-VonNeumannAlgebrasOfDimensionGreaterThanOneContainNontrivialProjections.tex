\begin{document}
{\bf \PMlinkescapetext{Proposition} -} Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a von Neumann algebra of dimension greater than one acting on an Hilbert space $H$. Then $\mathcal{M}$ contains a non-trivial projection, i.e. a projection that is not the \PMlinkname{zero}{ZeroMap} \PMlinkescapetext{nor} the identity operator.

$Note$ - As in the theory of $C^*$-algebras, for a projection we mean an orthogonal projection.
