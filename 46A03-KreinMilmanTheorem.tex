\begin{thm}
Let $X$ be a locally convex topological vector space, and let $K \subset X$
be a compact \PMlinkname{convex subset}{ConvexSet}.  Then $K$ is the closed convex hull of its extreme points.
\end{thm}

% FIXME: this needs to go into the convex hull entry or some such
The closed convex hull above is defined as the intersection of all closed convex subsets of $X$ that contain $K$.  This turns out to be the same as the closure of the convex hull in a topological vector space.
