{\bf Theorem  1 -} Let $X$ be a Banach space and $M$ a closed subspace. Then,
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$ is topologically complemented in $X$ if and only if there exists a continuous projection onto $M$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a topological complement $N$ of $M$, there exists a unique continuous projection $P$ onto $M$ such that $P(x+y)=x$ for all $x \in M$ and $y \in N$.
\end{itemize}


$\;$

The projection $P$ in the second part of the above theorem is sometimes called the \emph{projection onto $M$ along $N$}.

The above result can be further improved for Hilbert spaces.

{\bf Theorem 2 - } Let $X$ be a Hilbert space and $M$ a closed subspace. Then, $M$ is topologically complemented in $X$ if and only if there exists an orthogonal projection onto $M$ (which is unique).

$\,$

Since, by the orthogonal decomposition theorem, a closed subspace of a Hilbert space is always topologically complemented by its orthogonal complement ($X=M \oplus M^{\perp}$), it follows that

$\,$

{\bf Corollary -} Let $X$ be a Hilbert space and $M$ a closed subspace. Then, there exists a unique orthogonal projection onto $M$. This establishes a bijective correspondence between orthogonal projections and closed subspaces.
