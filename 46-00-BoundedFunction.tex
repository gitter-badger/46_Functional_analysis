{\bf Definition} Suppose  $X$ is a nonempty set. Then a function
$f:X\to \sC$ is a \emph{\PMlinkescapetext{bounded function}} 
if there exist a $C<\infty$ such that 
$|f(x)|<C$ for all $x\in X$. The 
set of all bounded functions on $X$ is usually 
denoted by $B(X)$ (\cite{aliprantis}, pp. 61).

Under standard point-wise addition and point-wise multiplication by
a scalar, $B(X)$ is a complex vector space. 

If $f\in B(X)$, then the \emph{sup-norm}, or \emph{uniform norm}, of $f$ 
is defined as 
$$ ||f||_\infty = \sup_{x\in X} |f(x)|. $$
It is straightforward to check that $||\cdot||_\infty$ makes $B(X)$ into
a normed vector space, i.e., to check that $||\cdot||_\infty$ satisfies the 
assumptions for a norm. 

\subsubsection{Example}
Suppose $X$ is a compact topological space. Further, let $C(X)$ be the
set of continuous complex-valued functions on $X$ (with the same vector
space structure as $B(X)$). Then $C(X)$ is a vector subspace of $B(X)$.
