{\bf Definition} Let $V$ be a topological vector space over a subfield of the complex numbers (usually taken to be $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$). If the topology of $V$ 
has a basis where each member is
a convex set, then $V$ is a \emph{locally convex topological 
vector space} \cite{folland}. 

Though most vector spaces occurring in practice are locally convex, the spaces $L^p$ for $0<p<1$ are examples of spaces which are not locally convex.
