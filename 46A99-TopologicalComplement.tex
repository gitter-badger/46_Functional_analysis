\subsubsection{Definition}
Let $X$ be a topological vector space and $M \subseteq X$ a \PMlinkname{closed}{ClosedSet} subspace.

If there exists a closed subspace $N \subseteq X$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
M \oplus N = X
\end{displaymath}
we say that $M$ is {\bf topologically complemented}.

In this case $N$ is said to be a {\bf topological complement} of $M$, and also $M$ and $N$ are said to be {\bf topologically complementary} subspaces.

\subsubsection{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is known that every subspace $M \subseteq X$ has an algebraic complement, i.e. there exists a subspace $N \subseteq X$ such that $M \oplus N = X$. The existence of topological complements, however, is not always assured.
\item If $X$ is an Hilbert space, then each closed subspace $M \subseteq X$ is topologically complemented by its orthogonal complement $M^{\perp}$, i.e.
\begin{displaymath}
M \oplus M^{\perp} = X .
\end{displaymath} 
\item Moreover, for Banach spaces the converse of the last paragraph also holds, i.e. if each closed subspace is topologically complemented then $X$ is isomorphic a Hilbert space. This is the \PMlinkname{Lindenstrauss-Tzafriri theorem}{CharacterizationOfAHilbertSpace}.
\end{itemize}
