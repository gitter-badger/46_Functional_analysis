\begin{document}
Let $f\colon \R\to\R$ be a function. We say that $f$ is of class $C^1$ if $f'$ exists and is continuous.

We also say that $f$ is of class $C^n$ if its $n$-th derivative exists and is continuous (and therefore all other previous derivatives exist and are continuous too).

The class of continuous functions is denoted by $C^0$. So we get the 
following relationship among these classes:
\[
C^0\supset C^1\supset C^2\supset C^3 \supset \ldots
\]

Finally, the class of functions that have continuous derivatives of any order is denoted by $C^\infty$ and thus
\[
C^\infty = \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty C^n.
\]
It holds that any function that is differentiable is also continuous
(see \PMlinkname{this entry}{DifferentiableFunctionsAreContinuous}). 
Therefore, $f\in C^\infty$ if and only if every derivative of $f$ exists.

The previous concepts can be extended to functions $f\colon \R^m \to \R$, 
where $f$ being of class $C^n$ amounts to asking that all the 
partial derivatives of order $n$ be continuous. 
For instance, $f\colon\R^m\to \R$ being $C^2$ means that
\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j\partial x_i}
\]
exists and are all continuous for any $i,j$ from $1$ to $m$.

\subsubsection*{$C^n$ functions on an open set of $\R^m$}
Sometimes we need to talk about continuity not globally on $\R$, 
but on some interval or open set. 

If $U\subseteq \R^m$ is an open set, and $f\colon U\to \R$ 
(or $f\colon U\to \C$)
we say that $f$ is of class $C^n$ if $\partial^\alpha f$
exist and are continuous for all multi-indices $\alpha$ with $|\alpha|\le n$. 
See \PMlinkname{this page}{MultiIndexNotation} for the multi-index notation.
