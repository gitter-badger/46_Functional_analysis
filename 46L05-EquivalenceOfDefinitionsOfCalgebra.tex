\begin{document}
In this entry, we will prove that the definitions of $C^*$ algebra given in the 
main entry are equivalent.

\begin{thm}
A Banach algebra $A$ with an antilinear involution $*$ such that
$\norm{a}^2 \leq \norm{a^* a}$ for all $a \in A$ is a $C^*$-algebra.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
It follows from the product inequality $\norm{ab} \leq \norm{a}\norm{b}$ that
\[ \norm{a}^2 \leq \norm{a^* a} \leq \norm{a^*}\norm{a}. \]
Therefore, $\norm{a} \leq \norm{a^*}$. Putting $a^*$ for $a$, we also have $\norm{a^*} \leq \norm{a^{**}} = \norm{a}$. Thus, the involution is an isometry: $\norm{a} = \norm{a^*}$.
So now,
\[ \norm{a}^2 \leq \norm{a^* a} \leq \norm{a}^2. \]
Hence, $\norm{a^* a} = \norm{a}^2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
A Banach algebra $A$ with an antilinear involution $*$ such that
$\norm{a^* a} = \norm{a^*}\norm{a}$ is a $C^*$-algebra.
