\begin{thm}
Any finite dimensional subspace of a normed vector space is closed.
\end{thm}

\textbf{Proof.} Let $(V, \| \cdot \|)$ be such a normed vector space, and $S \subset V$ a finite dimensional vector subspace.

Let $x \in V$, and let $(s_n)_n$ be a sequence in $S$ which converges to $x$. We want to prove that $x \in S$. Because $S$ has finite dimension, we have a basis $\{x_{1}, ..., x_{k}\}$ of $S$. Also, $x \in \operatorname{span}(x_{1}, ..., x_{k}, x)$. But, as proved in the case when $V$ is finite dimensional (see this \PMlinkescapetext{object's} \PMlinkname{parent}{EverySubspaceOfANormedSpaceOfFiniteDimensionIsClosed}), we have that $S$ is closed in $\operatorname{span}(x_{1}, ..., x_{k}, x)$ (taken with the norm induced by $(V, \| \cdot \|)$) with $s_{n} \rightarrow x$, and then $x \in S$. QED.

\subsubsection{Notes}
The definition of a normed vector space requires the   ground field to be  the real or complex numbers. Indeed, consider the following counterexample if that condition doesn't hold:

$V = \mathbb{R}$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$ - vector space, and $S = \mathbb{Q}$ is a vector subspace of $V$. It is easy to see that $\dim(S) = 1$ (while $\dim(V)$ is infinite), but $S$ is not closed on $V$.
