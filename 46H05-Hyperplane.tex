\begin{document}
Let $E$ be a linear space over a field $k$.  A hyperplane $H$ in $E$ is defined as the set of the form $$H=\{x\in E:f(x)=a\}$$ where  $a \in k$ and $f$ is a nonzero linear functional, $f \colon E \to k$.  If $k=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, then $H$ is called a \emph{real hyperplane} or \emph{complex hyperplane} respectively.

\textbf{Remark}.  When $k=\mathbb{C}$, the word ``hyperplane'' also has a more restrictive meaning: it is the zero set of a complex linear functional (by setting $a=0$ above).
