\begin{document}
{\bf Theorem -} Every \PMlinkname{topologically irreducible representation}{BanachAlgebraRepresentation} of a \PMlinkname{$C^*$-algebra}{CAlgebra} is algebraically irreducible.

$Remark -$ It follows easily from the definition that algebraically irreducible \PMlinkescapetext{representations} of any Banach *-algebra are always topologically irreducible. The above theorem says that for $C^*$-algebras the converse is also true.
