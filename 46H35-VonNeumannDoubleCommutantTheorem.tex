The von Neumann double commutant theorem is a remarkable result in the theory of self-adjoint algebras of operators on Hilbert spaces, as it expresses purely topological aspects of these algebras in terms of purely algebraic properties.

$\,$

{\bf Theorem - von Neumann \PMlinkescapetext{double commutant} -} Let $H$ be a \PMlinkname{Hilbert space}{HilbertSpace} and $B(H)$ its algebra of bounded operators. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a *-subalgebra of $B(H)$ that contains the identity operator. The following statements are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal M = \mathcal M''$, i.e. $\mathcal M$ equals its double commutant.
\item $\mathcal M$ is closed in the weak operator topology.
\item $\mathcal M$ is closed in the strong operator topology.
\end{enumerate}

$\,$

Thus, a purely topological property of a $\mathcal{M}$, as being closed for some operator topology, is equivalent to a purely algebraic property, such as being equal to its double commutant. 

This result is also known as the \emph{bicommutant theorem} or the \emph{von Neumann density theorem}.
