\begin{document}
The \emph{Hilbert parallelotope} $I^\omega$ is a closed subset of the Hilbert space $\mathbb{R} \ell^2$ (The symbol '$\mathbb{R}$' has been prefixed to indicate that the field of scalars is $\mathbb{R}$.) defined as
 $$I^\omega = \{(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots) \mid 0 \le a_i \le 1/(i+1) \}$$

As a topological space, $I^\omega$ is homeomorphic to the product of a countably infinite number of copies of the closed interval $[0,1]$.  By Tychonoff's theorem, this product is compact, so the Hilbert parallelotope is a compact subset of Hilbert space.  This fact also explains the notation $I^\omega$.

The Hilbert parallelotope enjoys a remarkable universality property --- every second countable metric space is homeomorphic to a subset of the Hilbert parallelotope.  Since second countability is hereditary, the converse is also true --- every subset of the Hilbert parallelotope is a second countable metric space.
