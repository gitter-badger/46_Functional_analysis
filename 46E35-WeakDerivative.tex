\begin{document}
Let $f\colon \Omega\to \R$ and $g=(g_1,\ldots,g_n)\colon \Omega\to \R^n$ be locally integrable 
functions defined on an open set $\Omega\subset \mathbf R^n$.
We say that $g$ is the \emph{weak derivative} of $f$ if the equality
\[
  \int_\Omega f \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} = - \int_\Omega g_i \phi
\]
holds true for all functions $\phi\in\mathcal C^\infty_c(\Omega)$ (smooth functions with compact support in $\Omega$) and for all $i=1,\ldots, n$. Notice that the integrals involved are well defined since $\phi$ is bounded with compact support and because $f$ is assumed to be integrable on compact subsets of $\Omega$.

\subsection*{Comments}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $f$ is of class $\mathcal C^1$ then the gradient of $f$ is the weak derivative of $f$ in view of Gauss Green Theorem. So the weak derivative is an extension of the classical derivative. 
\item
The weak derivative is unique (as an element of the Lebesgue space $L^1_{\mathrm loc}$) in view of a result about locally integrable functions.
\item
The same definition can be given for functions with complex values.
\end{enumerate}
